to install app

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

The database is psql hosted locally
database credentials not configured corrently on the sever https://github.com/Andile-coder/Epf_Assesment

How it works

1. The application assumes that a user can upload spreadsheets for multiple employees individually
2. The spreadsheet is converted into pqsl schema. 3 tables employees, salaries,expenditures
3. The data is requested back as json to create temporal graphs

note:

1. (error :employees named customers :( )
2. if expenditure doesnt appear please refresh page
3. database credetials should be yours
